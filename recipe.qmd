Gordon Ramsay's scrambled eggs are a culinary masterpiece, renowned for their creamy, velvety texture and rich flavor. He begins by cracking eggs into a cold pan, whisking them vigorously with a fork to incorporate air. As the eggs slowly cook over low heat, Ramsay constantly stirs them with a spatula, ensuring that they cook gently and evenly. He emphasizes the importance of patience, allowing the eggs to take their time in the pan, avoiding the rush of high heat. The result is a luxuriously smooth scramble, often finished with a dollop of butter for added richness and a sprinkle of chives for freshness. Ramsay's scrambled eggs are a perfect balance of tenderness and flavor, elevating a simple dish to an indulgent breakfast experience.
