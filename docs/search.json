    "text": "Greetings to all fans, I am Ranson Chong from Singapore Institute of Technology. I am currently doing Quarto web development for Module AAI1001 - Data Engineering and Visualization. To complete this assignment with maximum efficiency, I am going to idolise my favourite football player Lamine Yamal, and introduce his brilliance to all of you. Writing about him saves me an eternity worth of time as compared to writing about myself. Vamos!\nLamine is only 17 and plays for FC Barcelona. He is part of Spain’s Euro 2024 winning squad in Germany, where his contribution of 1 goal and 4 assists proved influential towards Spain’s triumph at the tournament. During this period, he was also preparing for his Cambridge examinations at the team’s hotel after training. Commendable effort for juggling between school and competition.\nTo find out more, visit: https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/football/barca-b/players/3673478/lamine-yamal\n\n\n\n© 2025 My Quarto Website.

    "text": "Watch on YouTube\nGordon Ramsay’s scrambled eggs are a culinary masterpiece, renowned for their creamy, velvety texture and rich flavor. He begins by cracking eggs into a cold pan, whisking them vigorously with a fork to incorporate air. As the eggs slowly cook over low heat, Ramsay constantly stirs them with a spatula, ensuring that they cook gently and evenly. He emphasizes the importance of patience, allowing the eggs to take their time in the pan, avoiding the rush of high heat. The result is a luxuriously smooth scramble, often finished with a dollop of butter for added richness and a sprinkle of chives for freshness. Ramsay’s scrambled eggs are a perfect balance of tenderness and flavor, elevating a simple dish to an indulgent breakfast experience."
